// 2. Maximum of Three Numbers:
// â—‹ Write a program that takes three integer inputs from the user and finds the
// maximum of the three numbers.
// â—‹ Ensure your program follows best practices for organizing code into modular
// functions, such as separate functions for taking input and calculating the
// maximum value.
